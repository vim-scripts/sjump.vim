When executed the plugin will display labels in the sign area and wait
for the user to enter a label. Then it will jump to the line with the
entered label and hide the labels (by removing the signs).

The plugin is mapped to the sequence gl. The mapping can be disabled with:
   let g:sjump_enable_keymap = 0

To put the mapping on another key:
   nmap <F9> :call sjump#JumpToLabel()<cr>

Requires: +signs
Use :version to see if +signs is enabled.
